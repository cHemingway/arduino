# JSON Schema

This is meant to be a simple message passing schema to standardise the expected format 
of communications between the Arduinos and the Raspberry Pi using JSON.


In the examples folder there are examples of each message type.

* The sensor example is what the Arduinos will send north to the Pi with sensor data.
* The servo example is what the Pi will send south to the Arduinos
* The ping examples show what will be sent both north and south by each device in response to a ping
request.
